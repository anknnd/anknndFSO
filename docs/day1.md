Hi. i've been trying to do this for a long time but never got anywhere to building up a momentum. This time around i feel very positive and this will likely be my long overdue foray into "blogging while coding" stuff.

# Day 1
- Got introduced to [Web Sequence Diagrams](https://www.websequencediagrams.com) and felt like i've found a good tool.
- A good recap and reiteration of importance of network tab of Chrome DevTools.
- Realised that i know JS but not very good with DOM API syntax.
