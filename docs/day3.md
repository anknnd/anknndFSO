# Day 3

- Assigning a piece of a component's state as the value of the input element makes it a controlled element.
- - Controlled element either needs to have onChange handler or readonly.
- Rendering collections require key attribute to be set.
- Effect hook is called after the component is rendered.
- - Takes 2 arguments. First is the function. Second is the array of dependencies that would trigger the hook.
- - No second argument defines that hook is called after every render. Empty array argument defines that the hook is called the first time only.
